# Solidity Contract

THE ACTUAL CONTRACT IS DEPLOYED ON SEPOLIA ETHER BLOCKCHAIN at [this link](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0xeF32811A7a295478e56f4c906BF6C4B38D7941cf) by [thirdweb](https://thirdweb.com/dashboard) ; but it still needs sufficient sepolia ether to run it for demonstration purposes so we run it locally.

## Deploying Contracts

```bash

# or
yarn deploy
```

## Releasing Contracts
